# ReactNative-ResponsiveMasterDetail 

Simple React Native + Typescript example project that manages a master-detail interface in a responsive way (two pages / two pane view depending on device width and orientation). 
To manage this, I used React useContext hook.

## Build

```bash
npm i 
npm run android (or npm run ios)
npm start
```
